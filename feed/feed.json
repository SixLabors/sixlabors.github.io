There are lots of commands to remember and when <a href=\"/posts/announcing-imagesharp-web-200/#hmac-processing-protection\">we added HMAC support in V2</a> we added a level of complexity we weren't happy with.</p>\n<p>To solve this issue we turned to ASP.NET tag helpers.</p>\n<p>ASP.NET tag helpers are useful because they provide a more natural syntax for creating HTML elements in server-side code. They allow developers to create HTML elements in a way that is similar to how they would write HTML markup in a Razor view.</p>\n<p>Some of the benefits of using tag helpers include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improved readability: Tag helpers make it easier to understand the purpose of the code by providing a clear and concise syntax that is closer to HTML.</li>\n<li>Reduced complexity: Tag helpers simplify the creation of complex HTML elements by reducing the amount of boilerplate code needed.</li>\n<li>Type safety: Tag helpers are strongly typed, which means that the compiler can catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime.</li>\n<li>Testability: Tag helpers make it easier to unit test server-side code by providing a cleaner separation of concerns between the server-side code and the HTML markup.</li>\n<li>Code reuse: Tag helpers can be used to encapsulate commonly used HTML elements, making it easier to reuse code across multiple views and pages.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Overall, ASP.NET tag helpers provide a more efficient and maintainable way to create HTML elements in server-side code.</p>\n<p>ImageSharp.Web V3 comes equipped with a custom tag helper called ImageTagHelper that allows the generation of all the commands supported by the middleware in an easily accessible manner. This includes automatic generation of HMAC command tokens.</p>\n<p>To use ImageTagHelper, all you have to do is add the following imports command to <code>_ViewImports.cshtml</code> in your project.</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">@addTagHelper *, SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>All ImageSharp.Web commands are strongly typed and prefixed with <code>imagesharp</code> to namespace them against potentially conflicting commands. Visual Studio intellisense with automatically provide guidance<br>\nonce you start typing.</p>\n<p>The syntax is concise and easy to follow.</p>\n<p>For example, in the following markup snippet we are asking the tag helper to generate a command that will resize the image to 300x200 px using padding if required and also set the background color of any additional padded sections to lime green.</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;img\n    src=&quot;sixlabors.imagesharp.web.png&quot;\n    imagesharp-width=&quot;300&quot;\n    imagesharp-height=&quot;200&quot;\n    imagesharp-rmode=&quot;ResizeMode.Pad&quot;\n    imagesharp-rcolor=&quot;Color.LimeGreen&quot; /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>The TagHelper will translate this markup to generate the following request url containing all the commands translated into a format the middleware can understand. It also transparently adds the matching HMAC token when the functionality is enabled and configured.</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">/sixlabors.imagesharp.web.png?width=300&amp;height=200&amp;rmode=Pad&amp;rcolor=32CD32FF&amp;hmac=21f93e41021df0d3f88b5e2a8753bb273f292598e1511df67ec7cfb63f0b2994\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>As you can see this massively simplifies command generation. An added bonus is that this functionality is also available to customers generating custom commands; we've made the ImageTagHelper type unsealed so that you can inherit the type and bring your own.</p>\n<p>You can see the collection of supported properties an option in the API <a href=\"https://docs.sixlabors.com/api/ImageSharp.Web/SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web.TagHelpers.ImageTagHelper.html\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-future\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Future <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-future\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We're currently entirely focused on <a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp.Drawing\" target=\"_blank\">SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors/Fonts\" target=\"_blank\">SixLabors.Fonts</a> now to bring them up to Release Candidate status.</p>\n<p>Following that we'll start looking towards V3 where the focus will be on adopting the latest .NET runtimes and bringing high performance on as many platforms as possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Closing <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#closing\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Thanks again for all the feedback and usage.

These options are accessible to all our decoders and allow us to do some very cool things.</p>\n<p>For example, the following code allows us to return the decoded image comprised of a single frame at the requested maximum size in each direction. For jpeg this is especially useful as it allows us to take advantage of super fast IDCT scaling operations within the format that give us an impressive performance boost and uses less memory in the process.</p>\n<p>The image is saved using the same image format using information added to the metadata following the decoding operation.</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-c#\">DecoderOptions options = new()\n{\n    MaxFrames = 1,\n    TargetSize = new(150, 150)\n};\n\nusing var image = Image.Load(options, inputStream);\nimage.Save(outputStream, image.Metadata.DecodedImageFormat);\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>To demonstrate how much of a performance improvement this offers.

This release is no different with many improvements across several areas.</p>\n<p>One of the areas that has long been a point of interest and a known performance issue has been our handling of alpha compositing.</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In computer graphics, alpha compositing or alpha blending is the process of combining one image with a background to create the appearance of partial or full transparency. It is often useful to render picture elements (pixels) in separate passes or layers and then combine the resulting 2D images into a single, final image called the composite. Compositing is used extensively in film when combining computer-rendered image elements with live footage. Alpha blending is also used in 2D computer graphics to put rasterized foreground elements over a background.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Alpha compositing is the backbone for any blending operation. This covers the simple act of overlaying an image to all complex drawing operations (<em>think lines, curves, brushes, pens, text</em>). In V2 this was a bottleneck for all those operations and greatly hindered our ability to ship an additional drawing package.</p>\n<p><strong>In V3 we've blown things out of the water and improved performance by a whopping 14.4x!</strong></p>\n<p>This was achieved by conducting a complete overhaul of the existing <code>Vector4</code> implementation (<em>6.1x faster than the previous implementation</em>) and introducing a new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions\" target=\"_blank\">AVX2</a> pipeline which brings improvement to 14.4x.</p>\n<p>This change will allow us to complete the ImageSharp.Drawing library safe in the knowledge that we can bring excellent performance to the table.</p>\n<p>In addition to those changes we've introduced a 2x speedup for all operations involving our <a href=\"https://docs.sixlabors.com/api/ImageSharp/SixLabors.ImageSharp.ColorMatrix.html\" target=\"_blank\"><code>ColorMatrix</code></a> type. This brings great improvement across all our filtering methods including adjustments for brightness and contrast.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-future\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Future <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-future\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We'll be publishing new releases over the next few days of all our libraries that depend on ImageSharp. That means a new major version <a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp.Web\" target=\"_blank\">SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web</a>.</p>\n<p>We'll also concentrate on shipping V1 versions of <a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp.Drawing\" target=\"_blank\">SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors/Fonts\" target=\"_blank\">SixLabors.Fonts</a> targeting a release date in the first half of this year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Closing <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#closing\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Thanks again for all the feedback and usage. It's been a pleasure to build ImageSharp so far and to see so many people try it out; we really appreciate it. Please continue exploring the product and learning what it's capable of.</p>\n",

This makes orientation handling<br>\nconfusing for users who expect images to be resized in accordance to what they observe rather than pure(and correct) methods.</p>\n<p>To accommodate this ImageSharp.Web parses the dimensions to use based upon decoded EXIF orientation values. This means that the image is processed in accordance with expectations no matter what orientation the input uses as you can see in the example image below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/exif-handling.png\" alt=\"EXIF Orientation Support\" class=\"img-fluid\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"hmac-processing-protection\" tabindex=\"-1\">HMAC Processing Protection <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#hmac-processing-protection\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In cryptography, an HMAC (sometimes expanded as either keyed-hash message authentication code or hash-based message authentication code) is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key. As with any MAC, it may be used to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and authenticity of a message.</p>\n<p>HMAC can provide authentication using a shared secret instead of using digital signatures with asymmetric cryptography. It trades off the need for a complex public key infrastructure by delegating the key exchange to the communicating parties, who are responsible for establishing and using a trusted channel to agree on the key prior to communication.</p>\n<p>Any cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-2 or SHA-3, may be used in the calculation of an HMAC; the resulting MAC algorithm is termed HMAC-X, where X is the hash function used (e.g. HMAC-SHA256 or HMAC-SHA3-512). The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the cryptographic strength of the underlying hash function, the size of its hash output, and the size and quality of the key.</p>\n<p>HMAC does not encrypt the message. Instead, the message (encrypted or not) must be sent alongside the HMAC hash. Parties with the secret key will hash the message again themselves, and if it is authentic, the received and computed hashes will match.</p>\n<p>With ImageSharp.Web it is possible to configure an action to generate an HMAC by setting the <code>ImageSharpMiddlewareOptions.HMACSecretKey</code> property to any byte array value. This triggers checks in the middleware to look for and compare a HMAC hash of the request URL with the hash that is passed alongside the commands.</p>\n<p>By default ImageSharp.Web will use a HMAC-SHA256 algorithm.</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-c#\">private Func&lt;ImageCommandContext, byte[], Task&lt;string&gt;&gt; onComputeHMACAsync = (context, secret) =&gt;\n{\n    string uri = CaseHandlingUriBuilder.BuildRelative(\n            CaseHandlingUriBuilder.CaseHandling.LowerInvariant,\n            context.Context.Request.PathBase,\n            context.Context.Request.Path,\n            QueryString.Create(context.Commands));\n\n    return Task.FromResult(HMACUtilities.ComputeHMACSHA256(uri, secret));\n};\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>Users can replicate that key using the same <code>CaseHandlingUriBuilder</code> and <code>HMACUtilities</code> APIs to generate the HMAC hash on the client. The hash must be passed via a command using the <code>HMACUtilities.TokenCommand</code> constant.</p>\n<p>Any invalid matches are rejected at the very start of the processing pipeline with a 400 HttpResponse code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-future\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Future <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-future\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We'll be focussing very heavily on <a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp.Drawing\" target=\"_blank\">SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors/Fonts\" target=\"_blank\">SixLabors.Fonts</a> now to bring them up to Release Candidate status.</p>\n<p>Following that we'll start looking towards V3 where the focus will be on adopting the latest .NET runtimes and bringing high performance on as many platforms as possible.</p>\n<p>ImageSharp.Web V2 is released under dual licenses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/pricing/\">Six Labors License</a> A permissive license that bring additional enterprise level support.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apache 2.0 license</a> AS-IS.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"closing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Closing <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#closing\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Thanks again for all the feedback and usage.

This was done to improve memory usage and remove some surprises for users.</li>\n<li>We've changed the way that underlying spans are accessed in high performance scenarios. This was done to improve memory safety.</li>\n<li>We've dropped the old NetStandard 1.3 target. This targeted frameworks not supported by Microsoft and was adding overhead to development.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/releases/tag/v2.0.0\" target=\"_blank\">release notes</a> for detailed release information.</p>\n<p>API documentation is available in our <a href=\"https://docs.sixlabors.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Docs site</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"performance\" tabindex=\"-1\">Performance <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#performance\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We've come a VERY long way since people started measuring our performance <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-image-processing/\" target=\"_blank\">back in 2017</a>.

Geddit?</em> 😀</p>\n<p>It's hard enough to build open source products for which customers want to buy support, but when your pricing structure acts as another hurdle holding potential customers back, you know you’ve got a problem.</p>\n<p>When we launched the first <a href=\"/posts/announcing-imagesharp-10-release-candidate-1/\">release candidate for ImageSharp a year ago</a>, we also launched a new license designed to give commercial users peace of mind. With that license we provided a collection of pricing options that covered five separate tiers and could be mixed and matched to what we thought would suit our customers needs. However, we quickly discovered that these pricing options were a fast moving train to complexity-ville and we found ourselves in a position where customers were frequently asking us questions before they could even understand how much a <a href=\"/pricing/license/\">Six Labors License with Commercial Support</a> would cost them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-simplify-pricing%3F\" tabindex=\"-1\">Why simplify pricing? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#why-simplify-pricing%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"/img/sixlabors-pricing.png\" alt=\"Six Labors pricing page\" class=\"img-fluid\"></p>\n<p>Our old pricing page wasn't ugly – in fact, we are really quite proud of the visual design of this section of the site but the number and complexity of licensing options was overwhelming. We knew we had to improve things to make it easier for our customers to make the right decision and be confident that they are getting the best value for money.</p>\n<p>Simplifying our pricing strategy was the way to go.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-what-has-changed%3F\" tabindex=\"-1\">So what has changed? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#so-what-has-changed%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>First off, what is staying the same? Our license and support promise is still the same. We will continue to provide excellent support with our fantastically permissive license. Our existing products will always remain open source and we'll always continue to do our best for the community and our customers.</p>\n<p>To do that we've reduced the number of options and the ability to mix and match purchases. We didn't realise the additional overheads mixing and matching was bringing to our clients purchasing departments and as a result nobody was using those options.</p>\n<p>We've introduced 3 simple licensing tiers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Independent Developer</strong> - Exactly as described, for independent developers who want to take advantage of our excellent support while keeping costs to an absolute minimum.</li>\n<li><strong>Boutique Agency</strong> - For smaller digital agencies and software houses. These licenses are transferable meaning that they are not tied to individual developers but by head count. We understand that staff come and go and want to ensure that licensing maintenance overheads are kept to an absolute minimum.</li>\n<li><strong>Enterprise</strong> - With no upper limit to the number of developers covered this option is perfect for larger companies with teams of developers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"our-commitment\" tabindex=\"-1\">Our Commitment <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#our-commitment\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We'll continue to talk to our customers and work with them to ensure their satisfaction. As we grow we want to bring you all along with us on our journey to develop the best graphics software in the .NET ecosystem. We've got some really great stuff in the pipeline for our products and we're very excited to be able to share it with you all soon!</p>\n<p>In the meantime <a href=\"/pricing/\">Check out our new pricing page</a>.</p>\n",

We still believe that ImageSharp is the smarter choice for the future, Microsoft agree...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing?view=netcore-3.1#remarks\" target=\"_blank\">The System.Drawing namespace is not recommended for new development, due to not being supported within a Windows or ASP.NET service and it is not cross-platform. ImageSharp and SkiaSharp are recommended as alternatives.</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We’d like to express our gratitude for everyone that has tried ImageSharp and has given us feedback. We know that thousands of you have been using the pre-1.0 product. Thanks! We’ve received a lot of feedback about design choices, user experience, performance, communication and other topics. We’ve tried our best to apply all of that feedback. The release is much better for it. We couldn’t have done it without you!</p>\n<p>If you haven't used ImageSharp before or haven’t used it in a while, now is a great moment to try it. You can enjoy the productivity and power of ImageSharp with no constraints, on any OS, with any tool and for any application. All of that fully open source, developed with the community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-future\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Future <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-future\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Today ImageSharp and accompanying projects are released under the permissive <a href=\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apache 2.0 license</a>.

We're a member of the .NET Foundation and are working with them to improve the .NET Open Source ecosystem for both maintainers of projects and the companies that use them.</p>\n<p>That future, however, can only be ensured with the help and support of the .NET community either by <strong><a href=\"/pricing/\">purchasing a Commercial Support License</a></strong> or by submitting code and documentation patches to the various <a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors\" target=\"_blank\">Six Labors repositories</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Without your support ImageSharp and co will go the way of other pioneering .NET projects like <a href=\"https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/issues/3010\" target=\"_blank\">NancyFX</a> and fade away into history.</strong></p>\n<p>But of course you'll help out... Why?</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/heroes-thor.jpg\" alt=\"Thor saying 'Because that's what heroes do'.\" class=\"img-fluid\"></p>\n<p>From a roadmap perspective we'll continue to bring usability and performance enhancements to ImageSharp but the immediate focus will shift to bringing <a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp.Drawing\" target=\"_blank\">SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp.Web\" target=\"_blank\">SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors/Fonts\" target=\"_blank\">SixLabors.Fonts</a> development up to a production ready standard.

The pixel type <code>TPixel</code> is a noise for people who just want to do simple things like resize &amp; resave an image. A major design goal of our libraries is to make things as simple as possible. Therefore we decided to no longer force users to operate with types like <code>Image&lt;Rgba32&gt;</code> when <code>Rgba32</code> is an implementation detail for them.</p>\n<p>Previously <code>Image</code> was a static helper class with methods to load images from different data sources.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting from beta 7, <code>Image</code> is an abstract, pixel-agnostic base class for the pixel-specific <code>Image&lt;TPixel&gt;</code> generic type.</strong></p>\n<p>Non-generic <code>Image.Load</code> overloads no longer return <code>Image&lt;Rgba32&gt;</code>. The pixel-agnostic <code>Image</code> is being returned instead:</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-c#\">using (Image image = Image.Load(&quot;foo.jpg&quot;))\n{\n    image.Mutate(x =&gt; x.Resize(100, 100);\n    image.SaveAsJpeg(someStream);\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>This change is also opening up optimization opportunities for future versions: if no specific pixel type is forced on the call site,  ImageSharp can decode/re-encode images into their &quot;native&quot; pixel formats faster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"adapting-existing-code\" tabindex=\"-1\">Adapting existing code <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#adapting-existing-code\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Yes, all overloads of the <code>Image.Load(...)</code> method went through a <strong>breaking change</strong>, and all users should recompile their projects after the package update. On the other hand the impacts should be minimal:</p>\n<h4 id=\"1.-simple-processing-code-using-var-should-be-unaffected%3A\" tabindex=\"-1\">1.

This gives you the power to alter individual frames in a really simple manner. We actually uses these APIs internally to track meta when loading and saving an image to ensure the default encoding properties match the input.</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code>// Load and minipulate the metadata for an animated gif frame\nusing(var image = Image.Load(&quot;input.gif&quot;)){\n    \n    var metaData = image.Frames[0].MetaData;\n    GifFrameMetaData gifMeta = metaData.GetFormatMetaData(GifFormat.Instance);\n    gifMeta.FrameDelay = 42;\n    gifMeta.ColorTableLength = 128;\n    gifMeta.DisposalMethod = GifDisposalMethod.RestoreToBackground;\n\n    image.Save(output.gif)\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>We've added two new pixel formats - <code>Gray8</code>, and <code>Gray16</code> which work well with the extended support we've added for png encoding. We plan on adding grayscale encoding to jpeg for the release candidate also.</p>\n<p>The <code>.DrawImage()</code> API now allows you to mix and match pixels formats.</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-c#\">image&lt;Rgba&gt;.Mutate(x =&gt; x.DrawImage( Image&lt;Argb&gt;)\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>We've added two new fluent builder APIs for building affine and projective transforms. These builders automatically calculated the resultant canvas for you and rescale it accordingly to fit your new image.</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-c#\">// Compose a rotation plus skew transform\nvar affineBuilder = new AffineTransformBuilder();\naffineBuilder.AppendRotationDegrees(36F)\n             .AppendSkewDegrees(15F, 10F);\n\nimage.Mutate(x =&gt; x.Transform(affineBuilder));\n\n// You can also inspect the raw matrix.\nMatrix3x2 = affineBuilder.BuildMatrix(image.Size());\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>We've also fleshed out support for handling different subtypes within image formats. Png now supports all configurations and Bmp can decode all known good Bmp configurations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bug-fixes\" tabindex=\"-1\">Bug Fixes <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#bug-fixes\">#</a></h3>\n<p>There's new  fixes added to this release (though we had relatively few reported issues from beta 5) and we've dramatically increased the number of unit tests (8280+) to ensure we don't introduce any new ones as we optimize further.</p>\n<p>That's only a brief highlight of changes.

We're very happy with the code quality of this beta and will be working hard to ship a release candidate before the end of <strong>Q1 2019</strong>.</p>\n<p>In the interim we'll focusing on further improving  memory usage and performance. I'm personally going to make a commited  effort to add comprehensive documentation to cover common scenarios in addition to our <a href=\"https://docs.sixlabors.com/api/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">API documentation</a>. I invite anyone will and able to help out.</p>\n<h3 id=\"licensing-plans\" tabindex=\"-1\">Licensing plans <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#licensing-plans\">#</a></h3>\n<p>ImageSharp and co are the culmination of over three years developmental effort made up of evenings and weekends. At SixLabors we strongly believe that we have developed a selection of products that are incredibly useful for the developer and business communities at large and as such should supported by those communities.</p>\n<p>Donations don't pay the bills so we are embarking on a journey to license and sell a selection of our libraries.</p>\n<p>As such, Beta 6 will be the last release we provide under Apache License. Upon releasing RC1 we will switch to a dual licensing model similar to the one <a href=\"https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/license.txt\" target=\"_blank\">provided by ServiceStack</a>.</p>\n<p>We are still working on the details, so nothing is for sure but what you can expect is something like this:</p>\n<p><strong>ImageSharp</strong>, <strong>ImageSharp.Drawing</strong>, and <strong>ImageSharp.Web</strong> will all be dual licensed under a <strong>AGPLv3/Commercial license</strong>. The AGPLv3 license will come with exceptions which allow bundling the code alongside all well known open source licenses (Apache 2.0, MIT etc). Any projects seen as direct competition (Imaging SDKs) will not be able to utilize that exception.</p>\n<p>The commercial license will apply to anyone that chooses not to open source any code which is derived from our APIs which is a direct violation of AGPLv3. Purchasing a commercial license will give the developer the right to bundle ImageSharp with their closed source codebase.</p>\n<p>Currently we are planning to offer the following commercial license models:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>A subscription license, per developer, per year with unlimited usage. This would be renewable for a maximum of 3 years before you automatically receive a perpetual license for unlimited developers and usage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A one time payment to receive an perpetual license for unlimited developers and usage.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will offer free commercial licenses for not-for-profit organizations and cheap licenses for indie developers.</p>\n<p>We're gonna be cheap, almost painfully so, in order to hopefully not drive away users.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions (eg. more details about pricing plans), please contact us on our <a href=\"https://gitter.im/ImageSharp/General\" target=\"_blank\">gitter channel</a>.</p>\n",

While you're reading that, download the updated package from <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/SixLabors.ImageSharp/\" target=\"_blank\">Nuget</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"documentation.\" tabindex=\"-1\">Documentation. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#documentation.\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Our new documentation, built with DocFX, is hosted at <a href=\"https://sixlabors.github.io/docs/\" target=\"_blank\">https://sixlabors.github.io/docs/</a>. There you will find complete API documentation for all the SixLabors libraries plus additional articles describing the where's and what-how's of ImageProcessing.</p>\n<p>Please bear in mind that this documentation is a work-in-progress, being very labor intensive to write. All pages offer edit links so please help out if you spot any errors!</p>\n<h2 id=\"memory-management\" tabindex=\"-1\">Memory Management <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#memory-management\">#</a></h2>\n<p>By default, ImageSharp uses ArrayPools for performance reasons, however, this behavior is fully configurable.<br>\nAll large buffers within the API are managed by the <code>MemoryManager</code> implementation associated to <code>Configuration</code> classes <code>MemoryManager</code> property. We default to using <code>ArrayPoolMemoryManager</code> in order to utilize the benefits of array pooling.</p>\n<p>This means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less pressure on the GC (Garbage Collector), because buffers are being reused most of the time.</li>\n<li>Reduced LOH (Large Object Heap) fragmentation.</li>\n<li>When working with unclean buffers is acceptable, we can spare on array cleaning behavior also.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pooling helps us to reduce CPU work and increase throughput by the cost of a larger memory footprint.</p>\n<h3 id=\"working-in-memory-constrained-environments\" tabindex=\"-1\">Working in Memory Constrained Environments <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#working-in-memory-constrained-environments\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Sometimes having larger memory footprint is not an option. Let's mention a few cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When horizontal scaling is achieved by having multiple memory constrained containers in a cloud environment.</li>\n<li>Mobile applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before scaling down pooling behavior because of unwanted <code>OutOfMemoryException</code>'s in a cloud or desktop environment, make sure that you are running your service in a 64 bit process.</p>\n<p>There are several pre-defined factory methods to create an <code>ArrayPoolMemoryManager</code> instance for memory constrained environments. For example <code>ArrayPoolMemoryManager.CreateWithModeratePooling</code> might be suitable in most constrained situations:</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-c#\">Configuration.Default.MemoryManager = ArrayPoolMemoryManager.CreateWithModeratePooling();\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>Of course, you may also configure a <code>MemoryManager</code> on your own <code>Configuration</code> instance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"filters\" tabindex=\"-1\">Filters <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#filters\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Filters were originally part of the SVG specification. However, when their usefulness became evident, W3C started working on adding some common filter effects to CSS as well.</p>\n<p>In beta 3 we've added filter methods by means of the <code>Matrix4x4</code> struct found in <code>System.Numerics.Vectors</code>.</p>\n<p>These methods match the behaviour of many CSS filters. You can use them to blur, brighten or saturate images among other things. They can be used alone or in combination with other filters.</p>\n<p>One big advantage with using the filter matrix is that composite filters can be obtained by matrix multiplication; the order of multiplication determining the transformed output.</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-c#\">using (var image = Image.Load(&quot;in.png&quot;))\n{\n    Matrix4x4 brightness = KnownFilterMatrices.CreateBrightnessFilter(0.9F);\n    Matrix4x4 hue = KnownFilterMatrices.CreateHueFilter(180F);\n    Matrix4x4 saturation = KnownFilterMatrices.CreateSaturateFilter(1.5F);\n    Matrix4x4 m = brightness * hue * saturation;\n\n    image.Mutate(i =&gt; i.Filter(m));\n\n    image.Save(&quot;out.png&quot;);\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>In addition to the composable filters we have added convenience methods for each individual filter. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-c#\">image.Mutate(x =&gt; x.Grayscale(GrayscaleMode.Bt709));\n\nimage.Mutate(x =&gt; x.Hue(-180F));\n\nimage.Mutate(x =&gt; x.Brightness(0.9F));\n\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>Additional methods can be found in the API documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"affine-transforms\" tabindex=\"-1\">Affine Transforms <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#affine-transforms\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In geometry, an affine transformation is a function between affine spaces which preserves points, straight lines and planes. Also, sets of parallel lines remain parallel after an affine transformation. An affine transformation does not necessarily preserve angles between lines or distances between points, though it does preserve ratios of distances between points lying on a straight line.</p>\n<p>Translation, scaling, rotation, and skewing are all classified as affine transforms.</p>\n<p>In beta 3 we've added affine transformation methods by means of the <code>Matrix3x2</code> struct found in <code>System.Numerics.Vectors</code>.</p>\n<p>As with filters the big advantage with using the transform matrix is that composite transforms can be obtained by matrix multiplication; the order of multiplication determining the transformed output.</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-c#\">using (var image = Image.Load(&quot;in.png&quot;))\n{\n    Matrix3x2 rotate = Matrix3x2Extensions.CreateRotationDegrees(45F);\n    var translate = Matrix3x2.CreateTranslation(5, 10);\n    var scale = Matrix3x2.CreateScale(.5F, .5F);\n    Matrix3x2 m = rotate * scale * translate;\n\n    image.Mutate(i =&gt; i.Transform(m, KnownResamplers.Bicubic));\n\n    image.Save(&quot;out.png&quot;);\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>In addition to the freeform transforms we have added convenience methods for <code>Rotate</code> and <code>Skew</code> with multiple overloads, that maintain the center point of the transformed image and automatically adjust the output image dimensions to fit.</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-c#\">image.Mutate(x =&gt; x.Rotate(45F));\n\nimage.Mutate(x =&gt; x.Skew(-20F, 10F));\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>All our transform methods have multiple overloads and accept the same <code>IResampler</code> implementation as <code>Resize</code> to determine the resampling filter to assign during processing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"metadata-only-decoding\" tabindex=\"-1\">Metadata-only decoding <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#metadata-only-decoding\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Our new feature is very similar to <code>magick identify</code> from <a href=\"https://www.imagemagick.org/script/identify.php\" target=\"_blank\">ImageMagick</a>. To enable work with metadata-only results the types <a href=\"https://sixlabors.github.io/docs/api/ImageSharp/SixLabors.ImageSharp.IImageInfo.html\" target=\"_blank\"><code>IImageInfo</code></a> and <a href=\"https://sixlabors.github.io/docs/api/ImageSharp/SixLabors.ImageSharp.Formats.PixelTypeInfo.html\" target=\"_blank\"><code>PixelTypeInfo</code></a> have been itroduced:</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-C#\">using (Stream stream = OpenMyStream())\n{\n    IImageInfo info = Image.Identify(stream);\n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;bits/pixel: &quot;  + info.PixelType.BitsPerPixel);\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"roadmap\" tabindex=\"-1\">RoadMap <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#roadmap\">#</a></h2>\n<p>All things going to plan this should be the last beta. We're very pleased with the shape and robustness of the API and we are not planning on making any more large-scale changes. We shall be concentrating now on bug fixes and performance improvements.</p>\n<p>We will however be considering:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Projective non-affine transforms (Tilt, Warp)</li>\n<li>Non-Rgb-based <code>TPixel</code> implementations (Cmyk, CieLab etc)</li>\n<li>Adding a full suite of colorspace conversion algorithms</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"you-can-help\" tabindex=\"-1\">You Can Help <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#you-can-help\">#</a></h2>\n<p>ImageSharp is fully open source and built for the community at large.

The generic nature of this design allows excellent flexibility when working with the different formats with each method format-agnostic.</p>\n<p>You want <code>Bgr24</code>? Use <code>Image&lt;Bgr24&gt;</code>! <code>Alpha8</code>? Use <code>Image&lt;Alpha8&gt;</code>, nice and easy!</p>\n<p>Many common operations have been added to our API and we've designed it to allow these to be performed simply but with great  flexibility .</p>\n<p>Check out this example resizing and transforming the colors of a jpeg:</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">// Image.Load(string path) is a shortcut for our default type.\n// Other pixel formats use Image.Load&lt;TPixel&gt;(string path)) or one of the many other available overloads.\nusing (Image&lt;Rgba32&gt; image = Image.Load(&quot;foo.jpg&quot;))\n{\n    image.Mutate(ctx =&gt; ctx\n         .Resize(image.Width / 2, image.Height / 2)\n         .Grayscale());\n    image.Save(&quot;bar.jpg&quot;); // Automatic encoder selected based on extension.\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"processing-images-with-mutate%2Fclone-and-extension-methods\" tabindex=\"-1\">Processing Images with Mutate/Clone and Extension Methods <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#processing-images-with-mutate%2Fclone-and-extension-methods\">#</a></h3>\n<p>We've got the API pretty much locked down but there's a fair amount of cheese moving from the previous alphas. (We apologise for that and salute early testers - You Rock!) The greatest of these changes is moving all our fluent image processing methods to two main operations: <code>Mutate</code> and <code>Clone</code>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>Mutate</code> applies a chain of operations on the original image, changing it's state:</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">image.Mutate(ctx =&gt; ctx.Operation1().Operation2() ...)\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><code>Clone</code> creates a clone of the original image with subsequent operations applied to the new instance:</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">using (Image&lt;Rgba32&gt; cloneImage = image.Clone(ctx =&gt; ctx.Operation1().Operation2() ...))\n{\n    // Operate on cloneImage\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>The original image is left untouched. <em>It's important to note, that you are responsible for the disposal of both images when creating a clone.</em></p>\n<p>We have a few good reasons behind this API decision:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Throughout the alpha API we realised that it wasn't obvious that the extension methods returned the same image instance. Many developers expected <code>image.Resize(...)</code> to return a new resized image, leaving the original untouched. Now we have provided control over this behaviour by distinguishing <code>Mutate()</code> and <code>Clone()</code>.</li>\n<li>The new <code>Clone(...)</code> operation enables optimizations behind the scenes. This might be very useful in use cases where both the original and the modified image instances should be preserved.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example, this operation ...</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">var mipmap1 = image.Clone(ctx =&gt; ctx.Resize(image.Width / 2, image.Height / 2);\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>... is cheaper than this one:</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">var mipmap1 = image.Clone();\nmipmap1.Mutate(ctx =&gt; ctx.Resize(image.Width / 2, image.Height / 2));\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>With extension methods operating on <code>IImageProcessingContext&lt;T&gt;</code> we are able to use the same fluent methods with both Mutate and Clone semantics. There's a veritable smörgåsbord of methods to choose from, each designed to handle a full range of use cases.</p>\n<p>This all means that there is much less noise around the main <code>Image&lt;T&gt;</code> class now  and we think that's much better.</p>\n<p>The API has also been designed to provide you the tools to allow you to implement your own algorithms and integrate the library into your own <a href=\"https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid\" target=\"_blank\">applications</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"direct-access-to-image-pixels\" tabindex=\"-1\">Direct Access to Image Pixels <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#direct-access-to-image-pixels\">#</a></h3>\n<p>During the alpha we introduced fast pixel manipulation API's utilizing <a href=\"https://github.com/adamsitnik/adamsitnik.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2017-07-13-Span.md\" target=\"_blank\"><code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code>, the new low level memory manipulation tool</a>, via  <code>image.GetRowSpan(rowIdx)</code> and <code>image.Pixels</code>. However, we faced several issues from exposing these methods publicly, the most difficult to overcome being that <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Memory/\" target=\"_blank\">System.Memory</a> will be in preview state until the 2.1 release of the .NET Standard.</p>\n<p>As such, we decided to internalize all the functions exposing <code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code> for now though we still have API's to directly access pixel data for most common use-cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can save pixels to a <code>byte[]</code> buffer by calling <code>image.SavePixelData(bytes)</code></li>\n<li>You can manipulate individual pixels by using indexers on <code>Image&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>ImageFrame&lt;T&gt;</code>. This is slower than writing Spans of rows, but still much faster than <code>System.Drawing</code>'s <code>GetPixel</code>/<code>SetPixel</code>!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We plan to reintroduce the <code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code> methods as soon as the first official release of <code>System.Memory</code> lands, providing a modern API for advanced users with low-level pixel manipulation needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"image-formats\" tabindex=\"-1\">Image Formats <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#image-formats\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Out of the box we support decoding and encoding of bmp, png, gif, and jpeg formats with tiff well underway. We've provided increased functionality for several formats (animation, quantization, compression) and extensible endpoints for implementing your own image formats.</p>\n<p><strong>For beta-1 we managed to solve all the most difficult issues affecting our Jpeg decoder:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved accuracy and standard-conformity. For most cases our output pixels are ~99.9% similar when compared to libjpeg-turbo output.<br>\n<em><strong>Update:</strong> An accuracy bug has been managed to sneak into <code>beta-1</code>, will be fixed in the next release!</em></li>\n<li>Significantly reduced memory consumption.</li>\n<li>We are capable of decoding <a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/issues/159\" target=\"_blank\">many</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/issues/178\" target=\"_blank\">kinds</a> of broken Jpegs, and manage errors properly in the <a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/issues/214\" target=\"_blank\">worst cases</a>.</li>\n<li>We achieved the previous points without performance drops! Although parallel processing is disabled in Jpeg decoder for now, single-core  performance has been improved since alpha releases thanks to several SIMD optimizations. We think that the lack of parallelism should not be an issue for server users, because throughput of high-load image processing services depends mostly on single core performance. However, multi-core Jpeg processing might be important for desktop/mobile users, so we plan to re-add it in future releases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We've also implemented support for EXIF and ICC metadata.</p>\n<h3 id=\"drawing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Drawing <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#drawing\">#</a></h3>\n<p>We support a full suite of shape, path and image drawing algorithms from complex polygons, simple straight lines, to image blending. All of which support the full range of <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#porterduffcompositingoperators\" target=\"_blank\">Porter-Duff</a> compositing operators</p>\n<p>Check out this example of loading an image, using the drawing API to draw a rectangle and blend it over the source images using the <code>source</code> blending mode. This will generate an image that looks like a frame with the outer edge 10 pixels from the source image.</p>\n<div class=\"frame\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">using (Image&lt;Rgba32&gt; image = Image.Load(&quot;foo.jpg&quot;))\n{\n    var borderSize = 10;\n    image.Mutate(ctx =&gt; ctx\n         .Fill(Rgba32.Transparent,\n           new RectangleF(borderSize, borderSize, image.Width - (borderSize * 2), image.Height - (borderSize * 2)),\n           new GraphicsOptions(true)\n           {\n               BlenderMode = PixelBlenderMode.Src // Enforces that any part of this shape that has color is punched out of the background\n           }));\n    image.Save(&quot;bar.jpg&quot;); // Automatic encoder selected based on extension.\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"so-what's-next%3F\" tabindex=\"-1\">So What's Next? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#so-what's-next%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Future work will come at a much faster cadence. We feel like we've done most of the difficult work now and will be able to concentrate on performance, bug fixes, and API tweaks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roadmap\" tabindex=\"-1\">Roadmap <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#roadmap\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The latest planned date for a v1.0 Final release is Q1 2018. This lines up with the scheduled release date of <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/roadmap.md\" target=\"_blank\">Net Standard 2.1</a> We're lining up with that release as we want to introduce fast API endpoints utilizing the <code>System.Memory</code> classes. If we are able to release before then we will do.</p>\n<p>In the interim we will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perform optimization of all our image formats introducing SIMD where required</li>\n<li>Add missing features where we can to our image formats</li>\n<li>Perform optimization on any manipulations algorithms where required</li>\n<li>Implement any missing sanitation code</li>\n<li>Expose a full suite of ColorSpace conversion algorithms</li>\n<li>Tweak public APIs to ensure they are as usable as possible</li>\n<li>Apply any bug fixes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionaly we shall create full API documentation for the library as well as and expanded set of sample projects within the Github repository to demonstrate the functionality we offer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"you-can-help\" tabindex=\"-1\">You Can Help <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#you-can-help\">#</a></h2>\n<p>ImageSharp is fully open source and built for the community at large.

(cross platform 2D graphics library, all that jazz). What started as a crazy idea, like the proverbial acorn, has blossomed into something much bigger and better...</p>\n<h2 id=\"introducing-six-labors\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors\" target=\"_blank\">Introducing Six Labors</a> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#introducing-six-labors\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Six Labors is an organisation concentrating the combined talents of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tocsoft\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Williams</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/antonfrv\" target=\"_blank\">Anton Firsov</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/James_M_South\" target=\"_blank\">James Jackson-South (Me)</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MagickNET\" target=\"_blank\">Dirk Lemstra</a> to bring into the world a suite of awesome, Open Source, .NET tools.</p>\n<p>We think it's a fantastic way for us to ensure our work flourishes and helps us spread the workload a little.</p>\n<p>Working with these chaps on ImageSharp has been an incredible experience for me and has allowed us to build something that really is world class. They each bring something special to the project and have taught me personally a huge amount about both programming and managing open source projects.</p>\n<p>Making our collaboration official seemed like a no-brainer. We hope you agree.</p>\n<p>As of today we have 3 main projects. You can find them all on <a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"imagesharp\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"/products/imagesharp\">ImageSharp</a> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#imagesharp\">#</a></h3>\n<p>ImageSharp is a fully featured, fully managed, cross-platform, 2D graphics API designed to allow the processing of images without the use of System.Drawing.</p>\n<p>Built against .NET Standard 1.1 ImageSharp can be used in device, cloud, and embedded/IoT scenarios.</p>\n<h3 id=\"shapes\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"https://github.com/SixLabors/Shapes\" target=\"_blank\">Shapes</a> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#shapes\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Shapes is a 2D polygon manipulation and interrogation library written in c# and targets .NET Standard 1.1  making it entirely cross-platform and will run on everything from android phone, to windows desktops, to Linux servers and everything in between.</p>\n<p>Shapes is currently still in alpha but is being used by <a href=\"/products/imagesharp\">ImageSharp</a>  for its line and vector drawing code.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fonts\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"/products/fonts\">Fonts</a> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#fonts\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Fonts is an true type/woff compatible font loading library written in c# and targets  .NET Standard 1.1 making it entirely cross-platform. This means it will run on everything from Android phone, to Windows desktops, to Linux servers and everything in between.</p>\n<p>Fonts provides text measuring, layout, and abstracted rendering systems. You just need to plugin your own rasterizer (like <a href=\"/products/imagesharp\">ImageSharp</a>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-what's-next...\" tabindex=\"-1\">So What's Next... <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#so-what's-next...\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Well... Actually I lied earlier. We've still got to move ImageSharp into the organisation repo (We need to close a couple of PR's first) Once, we've done that and a little cleanup we're going to push ImageSharp to Nuget along with the rest of our projects so you can download and experiment with it.</p>\n<p>Eventually we're going to introduce support contracts for our libraries so you can save time on your projects with direct access to us.  (Think developer questions, architectural guidance, feature requests).</p>\n<p>This site will become the go-to place for news, documentation for all our libraries so please bookmark and share this site and comment on our blogposts. We're building high quality software here that we want you to benefit from!</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n<p><strong>P.S.
